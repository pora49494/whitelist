I would first like to thank my advisor, assistant professor Hideya Ochiai and professor Hiroshi Esaki for advising, supporting and encouraging me throughout this entire year. Thank you for answering my every little question, for teaching me even the simplest thing.  

I would also like to thank doctor Manabu Tsukada and research associate Seiichi Yamamoto for prepping me for the presentation and for sharing your point of view. This helps me reflect on my own work and help me improve my research. 

Thanks to doctor Satoru Kobayashi for help structuring and organizing my presentation. Thanks to Mr. Tomoki Suga for helping investigate the tested IoT subject. Thanks to Yudai Aratsu for answering my tedious question. Thank to Hideyuki Nagashima and Matsuoka Katsuya for providing me the much-needed equipment.  

I also would like to thank to all my seniors and my friends for encouraging me, for helping in both academic life and social life, for understanding and bearing with my poor Japanese, for making this year such a precious year of my life. 

At last I would like to thank to my family who always be there to support me.
