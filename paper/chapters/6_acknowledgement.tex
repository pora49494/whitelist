I would first like to thank my advisors, professor Hiroshi Esaki and assistant professor Hideya Ochiai for advising, supporting and encouraging me throughout this entire year. Thank you for answering my every little question, for teaching me even the simplest things.  

Beside from my advisors, I would also like to thank doctor Manabu Tsukada and research associate Seiichi Yamamoto for prepping me for the presentation and for sharing their profound point of view. This helps me reflect on my own work and improve my research. 

Thanks to doctor Satoru Kobayashi for help structuring and organizing my presentation. 
Thanks to Mr. Touki Suga for helping investigate the tested IoT subject. 
Thanks to Mr. Yudai Aratsu for answering all my questions. 
Thanks to Mr. Hideyuki Nagashima and Mr. Matsuoka Katsuya for providing me the much-needed equipment. 
Thanks to Mr. Genta Imai for help proofreading this thesis.

I also would like to thank to all my seniors and my friends for encouraging me, for helping in both academic life and social life, for understanding and bearing with my poor Japanese, for making this year such a precious year of my life. 

Finally, I would like to express my gratitude to my family who always be there to me.  
Thank you.
