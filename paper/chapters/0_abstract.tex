In this paper, we have discussed the possibility and the capability of IoT devices, it is undeniable that IoT devices will become a part of human society. However, IoT system security is considerably weak and the risk of problem like privacy intruding, spying, data stealing, occurring is high. In order to help solving the IoT security problem, we have proposed the security system using the whitelist method and switch-level security. The system has three operation stage: Preparation, Analyzation and Operation stage. System traffic data is captured during Preparation stage. In Analyzation stage, the system discovers all IoT devices in the system, and examine their communication pattern to extract the whitelist. During Operation stage, only packet from hosts is the whitelist is accepted. We have conducted an experiment to find a way to implement the mentioned functions. We found that the best way to discover devices is to analyze ARP request packet. The secure hosts of each device are the host which our devices initiate the connection to. We have implemented filtering function using “iptables” command. The result showed that this approach worked well with the tested IoT subject, discovering all devices and extracting most of device’s secure host.
